    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To <b>build a revenue </b> selling rafting equipment, and tours, the company "Rushing rapids" is building this site to <b>share educational information </b> about rafting sport, and demostrate how exciting it is. And, to suggest the best places to practice this sport, will give tips about camping, and everything you need to buy to enjoy the rapids and camping experience</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This sport demand a strong physical performance, courage (adrenaline thirsty, interested in wild nature sports as rafting) and enough economical estability to plan for vacations that need expensive equipment this audience income should be above the total cost of all esential resources in that place, assuming that "Rushing rapids" is located in United States (specifically, in Glenwood Springs close to Colorado River Whitewater) </br>
    Audience for rafting equipment aren't limited to live near from the store, but to buy tours packages, this audience should live close enough to get to the start point of the tour or have enough money to pay for a plane from any place in the world. But "Rushing rapids" will be principally focused on Colorado habitants and secondary the rest of United State people</br>
    It’s important to understand that this kind of experience could get risky and we need serious people who will follow instructions to be safe. Could be obvious, but those who don’t meet the physical requirement to stay safe in case of an accident, aren’t allowed to participate, at least should be capable to swim.</br>
