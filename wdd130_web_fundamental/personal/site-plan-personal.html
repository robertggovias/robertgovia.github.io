        <h4>Grab more attention</h4> 
        This is an era where brands and businesses are moving towards the latest techniques to penetrate in the market.
One of the latest techniques that are moving businesses forward is video content.
There has been a great explosion of videos on the website as well as social media that is greatly catching the attention of viewers more than any static content.
With the boom of social media especially Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, people are diverting to watch more videos instead of static content. Social videos are shared 1200% more than any text or pictures. Millions of people browse Facebook and other social media sites. According to stats, people spend more than 100 million hours watching videos on Facebook. People like to have entertainment and absorb full info in just shorter time and this is the reason they want to watch videos instead of static content pieces.
        With the passage of years, the growth of video content is swelling and brands are seeing an avid growth through video content on social media like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. Branded video content has obtained increased views on YouTube. When it comes to Twitter, people retweet a video 6 times more than any static content.
        <h4>Explain faster</h4>
        One minute of video is worth 1.8 million words, according to Dr. James McQuivey of Forrester Research.
        Animated videos can be a great format for hard-to-grasp concepts that need strong visuals or to explain an abstract service or product.
        video is a great way to showcase all you have to offer.
        Research suggests the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is watched, compared to 10% when it is read. This means prospects are more likely to remember your message via a video ad than an image or text ad. Moreover, a user’s positive experience with a video ad increases their purchase intent by 97% and brand association by 139%.
        <h4>Boosting sellings</h4>
        73% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase after watching videos that explain a product or service—Animoto
        https://www.clearpivot.com/
        73% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase after watching videos that explain a product or service.
        Not only did video drive stronger conversion, but also generated the most efficient cost per lead, and 75% of the overall click volume. This is also consistent in customer engagement campaigns. Throughout various iterations and tests with my client, we found that videos consistently drove 2-3x higher CTRs than statics.

    <h4>2D Motion Graphics</h4>
    2D Motion Graphics are a style of digital animation that give movement (and life) to images. These images can come from any digital source. They can be original art, photos, vectors — pretty much type of digital image can be used as a starting point.
    <h4>3D Motion Graphics</h4>
    3D animation is a graphic technique that utilizes motion in order to bring characters, objects, props, and more to life. Though 3D animation has primarily been used in the creation of video games, films, and TV shows, its usages have grown alongside its popularity.
    <h4>Visual effects</h4>
    VFX allows filmmakers to create environments, objects, creatures, and even people that would otherwise be impractical or impossible to film in the context of a live-action shot. VFX in film frequently involves the integration of live-action footage with computer-generated imagery (CGI).
    <h4>Interactive Motion Graphics<h/4>
        An interactive graphic is a way to present data to users who visit a page containing animations and customizations, creating a unique experience for those who wish to check specific information.

Therefore, instead of just presenting a fixed frame, you can let each user interact with the image in any way they want.
