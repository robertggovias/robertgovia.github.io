          latest techniques to penetrate in the market. One of the latest
          techniques that are moving businesses forward is video content. There
          has been a great explosion of videos on the website as well as social
          media that is greatly catching the attention of viewers more than any
          static content. With the boom of social media especially Facebook,
          Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, people are diverting to watch more
          videos instead of static content. Social videos are shared 1200% more
          than any text or pictures. Millions of people browse Facebook and
          other social media sites. According to stats, people spend more than
          100 million hours watching videos on Facebook. People like to have
          entertainment and absorb full info in just shorter time and this is
          the reason they want to watch videos instead of static content pieces.
          With the passage of years, the growth of video content is swelling and
          brands are seeing an avid growth through video content on social media
          like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. Branded video
          content has obtained increased views on YouTube. When it comes to
          Twitter, people retweet a video 6 times more than any static content.

        <h2>Explain faster</h2>
        <p>
          One minute of video is worth 1.8 million words, according to Dr. James
          McQuivey of Forrester Research. Animated videos can be a great format
          for hard-to-grasp concepts that need strong visuals or to explain an
          abstract service or product. video is a great way to showcase all you
          have to offer. Research suggests the average user remembers 95% of a
          message when it is watched, compared to 10% when it is read. This
          means prospects are more likely to remember your message via a video
          ad than an image or text ad. Moreover, a user’s positive experience
          with a video ad increases their purchase intent by 97% and brand
          association by 139%.

        <h2>Boosting sellings</h2>
        <p>
          73% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase after watching
          videos that explain a product or service—Animoto
          https://www.clearpivot.com/ 73% of consumers are more likely to make a
          purchase after watching videos that explain a product or service. Not
          only did video drive stronger conversion, but also generated the most
          efficient cost per lead, and 75% of the overall click volume. This is
          also consistent in customer engagement campaigns. Throughout various
          iterations and tests with my client, we found that videos consistently
          drove 2-3x higher CTRs than statics.
