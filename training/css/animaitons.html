        <div>
        transition-property - specifies the property to be transitioned</div>
        <div>transition-duration - specifies the duration over which transitions should occur</div>
            <div>transition-timing-function - specifies how the pace of the transition changes over its duration</div>
                <div>transition-delay - specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect</div>

                    <div>In the example below, we set the transition property to transform, with a duration of 5 seconds, and with an ease-in timing function that specifies a transition effect with a slow start.
</div>
<p class="animated">ease - the animation starts slowly, then accelerates quickly.
    ease-in - starts slowly, then accelerates, and stops abruptly.
    ease-out - starts quickly, but decelerates to a stop.
    ease-in-out - similar to ease, but with more subtle acceleration and deceleration.
    linear - constant speed throughout the animation; often best for color or opacity changes.
