      <h4>My hometown</h4>
          <p>I born in "Lagunillas" City, Zulia State, Venezuela. (many years ago, we build the largest bridge in across the world.
             (There are a lot of misinformation about Venezuela, some of them aren't the truth, so you can ask me which is the truth about living here)
            But, actually I'm living in Canoas city, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.
            </p>
      <h4>Mayor in Byu-Idaho</h4>
          <p>Technology applied (But to be honest I love Data Science since 5 years ago)</p>          
      <h4> My profesion, actually</h4>
          <p>Currently, I'm a Bachelor in Advertisement and Marketing.</p>
      <h4>My recomendation</h4>
      <p>I recommend Sololearn to learn to code.</p>
          <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/1321495">You can see here My Certificates (sololearn software courses)</a>


      <h4>My special skill?</h4>
          <p>Also, I'm passionate about 3d modelling and animation I've been working with Blender since many years ago (Ten Years). My new objective is to learn to code in three.js (Interactive 3d). I created this simple animation for a Tv Commercial.</p>

<h4>I love most from Byu-Idaho? </h4>
<p>
  I've waited many years for this kind of opportunity. Now I appreciated it, even more, thanks for all the virtual teacher that helped me I understand that this could be even better than traditional educative thinking.</p>
<h4>
How I will get something from this mayor?  
      </h4>
      <p>As advertiser and designer, I want to explore by myself all the possibilities ready to be developed, yes, to be more engaged with huge markets of consumers across the world.</p>
