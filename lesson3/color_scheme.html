                            “Weather Schedule” was designed for organized people like you, yes, you prefer to be aware from a storm before that picnic, beach day, hiking adventure, or your outdoor weeding, but you never found a weather warning in the same place just right there with your schedule plan, but don’t worry, it’s okay, your suffering ends today!
                            Weather schedule site it’s just like its name, a place to make bulletproof plans. Right now we are testing the service within this places: Preston, Soda Springs, Fish Haven. Are you living there? Become a pioneer of this project and stay tune!

                            This speech represents the site purpose from client’s side, but being more accurately and professional about the purpose of the company it’s needed to state that “Weather Schedule” is a project that will be launched to worldwide market but it’s testing its product using focus groups from this 3 places. Even when the site was made for testing purposes, will launch the advertising campaign.
